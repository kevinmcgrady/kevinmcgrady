                In the beginning, I studied Web Development at The City of
                Glasgow College where I achieved an HND in Web Development. I
                loved every moment of it. I then moved on to The University of
                the West of Scotland where I was awarded a BSc in Web &amp;
                Mobile Development with Distinction. While at university I was
                lucky enough to be awarded the Court Medal for my efforts!
